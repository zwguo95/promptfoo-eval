You are grading the rationale line for a SNAP multiple-choice answer.

Score between 0.0 and 1.0:

- 1.0: Rationale is concise, policy-correct, and clearly supports the chosen letter with a relevant rule or fact.
- 0.5: Rationale is partially correct or vague (e.g., generic benefits language) but not misleading.
- 0.0: Rationale is incorrect, misleading, or unrelated to SNAP policy.

Return ONLY a number between 0.0 and 1.0.
