You are grading the groundedness of a SNAP chatbot answer.

Focus on the *citations line*. Assign a score from 0.0 to 1.0:

- 1.0: At least one citation is present, relevant, and plausibly supports the rationale (e.g., cites SNAP rules, official handbooks, or policy docs).
- 0.5: A citation is present but is vague, generic, or not clearly tied to the rationale.
- 0.0: No citation provided, or the citation is irrelevant/made up.

Return ONLY a number between 0.0 and 1.0.
